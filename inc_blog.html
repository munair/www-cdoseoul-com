                    <p>What does walking on your hands have to do with intelligence? I'd wager quite a lot. Apart from improving <a href="http://www.educlime.com/wharemosk.html" target="_new">motor skills</a>, the beautiful movements used in playing Capoeira help you to see the world differently. That new found perspective spills over into work and everyday life, giving you the creativity to address the multitude of challenges that we all must face everyday.</p>
                    <p>Here are three reasons why Capoeira helps improve intelligence.</p>

                    <p>Expats often arrive in Korea and feel isolated within weeks. They feel cut out of mainstream society and opportunities to grow and progress. It doesnâ€™t matter whether the expats are English teachers or business consultants for Samsung with Wharton MBAs. All expats are immediately thrown into a battle against a shrinking social circle and opportunities for genuine bonding.</p>
		    <p>Having survived six years in Korea, I am acutely aware that I would never have been able to do it without the help of my Capoeira group. Here are five reasons why Capoeira helps expats integrate into Korea.</p>

                    <p>Mastery of the beautiful and creative movement that makes Capoeira the most graceful and enchanting way to get and stay in shape requires a lot of preparation before class even starts. This is why I often emphasize that we "live" Capoeira, we do not "do" it like people do swimming or cycling. These activities end after an hour or so, but Capoeira doesn't. Capoeira is a lifestyle. To optimize our ability to move in the artistic and creative ways Capoeira demands of us, we have to make some important changes to our lifestyle. Here are six basic ways to radically optimize your mastery of moves that you will learn and train in class.</p>
